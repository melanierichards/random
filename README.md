## Exploration Notes

### Amari

#### Empty list item to copy

```
<li>
  <a href="" title="">
    <img src="./assets/amaro/.png" alt="">
  </a>
</li>
```

#### Rough cutouts of bottles

Note to self, in Photoshop I:

1. Made sure the image was 600px tall (using images from Drizly helps ensure these are the same size).
2. Used the magnetic lasso tool to naively trace the shape of the bottle.
3. Select > Modify > Expand by 20px.
4. Right click to select inverse and delete it.
5. Copy and paste to a new image to save a copy with no negative space.
